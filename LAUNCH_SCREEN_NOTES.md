# Launch Screen Implementation

## Overview
The app now features an animated launch screen that displays while the app initializes.

## Features
- **Animated Infinity Symbol**: A smooth, drawing animation of an infinity symbol with gradient colors (blue to purple)
- **Workout Figures**: Two animated stick figures performing workout movements, bouncing in sync
- **App Name**: "Lifehack" title with gradient styling that fades in
- **Loading Dots**: Three animated dots indicating loading progress
- **Smooth Transition**: 2.5-second display duration with fade-out transition to main app

## Technical Details
- **File**: `LifehackApp/LaunchScreenView.swift`
- **Integration**: Managed via `@State` in `LifehackApp.swift`
- **Duration**: 2.5 seconds before transitioning to `RootTabView`
- **Animations**:
  - Infinity symbol drawing (2.0s loop)
  - Pulse scaling effect (1.5s loop)
  - Figure bounce animation (0.8s loop)
  - Loading dots staggered animation (0.6s each with delays)

## Customization
To adjust the launch screen duration, modify the delay in `LifehackApp.swift`:
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2.5) {
    // Change 2.5 to desired seconds
}
```

## Design Elements
- **Background**: Dark gradient (matching app theme)
- **Colors**: Blue/purple gradients for visual consistency
- **Typography**: Rounded, bold font for the app name
- **Animation Style**: Smooth, professional easing
