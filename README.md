## Overview
This repository contains the iOS LifehackApp with comprehensive device selection and compatibility management. The app addresses device selection issues in dropdown menus and ensures compatibility with all current and future iPhone models.

## Problem Solved
The original issue was that users couldn't select their specific iPhone models from dropdown menus, particularly:
- ✅ **iPhone 13 Pro Max (1TB)** - Now available in device selection
- ✅ **iPhone 17 Pro Max (2TB)** - Now available for future use

## Features

### Device Management

- **Smart Dropdown Selection**: Organized device selection with storage options
- **Compatibility Checking**: Validates device compatibility with the app
- **Current Device Detection**: Automatically detects and displays current device information

### Supported Devices
The app includes support for:
- iPhone 13 series (all models and storage options)
- iPhone 14 series (all models and storage options)
- iPhone 15 series (all models and storage options)
- iPhone 16 series (all models and storage options)
- iPhone 17 series (future devices with up to 2TB storage)

## Key Components

### DeviceManager.swift
- **Purpose**: Manages device compatibility and selection
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getAllSupportedDevices()`: Returns all supported device configurations
  - `getDeviceVariants(for:)`: Gets storage variants for specific models
  - `isDeviceSupported(name:storageCapacity:)`: Validates device support
  - `findUserDevices()`: Finds user's specific devices mentioned in requirements

### ViewController.swift
- **Purpose**: Main UI for device selection and management
- **Features**:
  - Interactive device selection dropdown
  - Current device detection and display
  - Compatibility status indication
  - User-friendly device selection interface

## Testing
Run the test script to verify device selection functionality:
```bash
swift test_device_selection.swift
```

Expected output confirms:
- ✅ iPhone 13 Pro Max (1TB) is available in dropdown
- ✅ iPhone 17 Pro Max (2TB) is available for future use
- ✅ All device variants are properly supported

## Development Requirements
